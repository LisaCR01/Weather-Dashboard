# Weather-Dashboard

In this project built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The purposes of this project is to highlight the use of third party APIs because of how developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. The API that I use in this project is OpenWeather One Call API, which let me retrieve weather data for different cities. The central things I use in this project is: my OpenWeather key API, local storage and the use of icons. 

## Criteria that I met to achieve this

* When the user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city.
* After the user has searched for a city they are added to the search history.
* When the user views the current weather conditions for the city they have searched, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
* When the user views the UV index, they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. 
  * green = favorable
  * yellow = moderate
  * red = severe
* When the user views future weather conditions for the city of interest, they are presented a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
* When the user clicks on a city in the search history they are presented with current and future conditions for that city.
